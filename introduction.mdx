Thank you for your interest in Trackstar! If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to `support@trackstarhq.com`. Access to the API can be requested via [our website](https://trackstarhq.com).

### What is Trackstar?
Trackstar is a Unified API that provides standard endpoints for Supply Chain Logistics.
We currently offer an API for Warehouse Management Systems (WMS).

We provide a drop-in frontend authentication component that makes it easy to connect to your customers' end systems.

Once you add Trackstar and integrate with our endpoints once, you automatically have support for all existing and new integrations we add.
