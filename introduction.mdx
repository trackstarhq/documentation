Thank you for your interest in Trackstar! If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to `support@trackstarhq.com`. Access to the API can be requested via [our website](https://trackstarhq.com).

### What is Trackstar?
Trackstar is a Unified API that provides standard endpoints for Supply Chain Logistics.
We currently offer an API for Warehouse Management Systems (WMS).

We provide a drop-in frontend authentication component that makes it easy to connect to your customers' end systems.

Once you add Trackstar and integrate with our endpoints once, you automatically have support for all existing and new integrations we add.


### About Our Endpoints
The Trackstar API can be queried via HTTP REST endpoints. We follow standard HTTP authentication, response codes, and verbs.
Our API accepts JSON-encoded requests which are all documented here. All of our responses are returned as JSON.
All requests must be made via `https` and all requests should be made to `https://production.trackstarhq.com/`
