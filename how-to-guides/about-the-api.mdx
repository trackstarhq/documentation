The Trackstar API can be hit at https://production.trackstarhq.com.

Trackstar API responses are all returned in JSON format.

## Errors

Standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure of an API request.

Error response bodies are returned in the following format:
```json
{
    "error": "Sample error message"
}
```
and will have a status code associated with them.

### Unimplemented Endpoints

Endpoints that are not supported for a given integration (e.g. `GET /wms/returns` for the `Cool WMS` integration)
will return a `501` status code with the following body:
```json
{
    "error": "Endpoint get_returns is not implemented for Cool WMS"
}
```


## Pagination

Endpoints that list data retrieve the maximum number of result by default.
These endpoints implement pagination logic and return a `next_token`, which will be `null` if there is no additional data.
Valid `next_token`s can then be passed into the endpoint's `page_token` parameter to get the next page of results.
Leave this field out to get the first page.
