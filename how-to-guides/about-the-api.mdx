The Trackstar API can be hit at https://production.trackstarhq.com.

Trackstar API responses are all returned in JSON format.

## Authentication

All Trackstar API requests require an API Key to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Trackstar dashboard](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/settings/api-keys).

Additionally most endpoints also require an access token, which maps to an integrated WMS. Access tokens are returned at the end of the [Token Exchange](/how-to-guides/getting-started#2-implement-token-exchange-endpoints-be) process. They can also be found in the [Connections page of the Trackstar dashboard](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/connections).

To authenticate a request, include the following headers:
```bash
headers = {
    "x-trackstar-api-key": "<x-trackstar-api-key>",
    "x-trackstar-access-token": "<x-trackstar-access-token>" # When required
}
```

## Postman Collection

The Trackstar Postman collection can be found in JSON format at https://production.trackstarhq.com/postman.json.
To use it, simply open the Postman [app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [web client](https://postman.co/home),
click "Import", and type in the above URL.

## Errors

Standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure of an API request.

Error response bodies are returned in the following format:
```json
{
    "error": "Sample error message"
}
```
and will have a status code associated with them. Some types of errors will contain additional fields, but all will contain `"error"`.

### Unimplemented Endpoints

Endpoints that are not supported for a given integration (e.g. `GET /wms/returns` for the `Cool WMS` integration)
will return a `501` status code with the following body:
```json
{
    "error": "Endpoint get_returns is not implemented for Cool WMS"
}
```


## Pagination

Endpoints that list data retrieve 1000 items by default. You can change this using the `limit` query parameter.
Endpoints implement pagination logic and return a `next_token`, which will be `null` if there is no additional data.
Valid `next_token`s can then be passed into the endpoint's `page_token` parameter to get the next page of results.
Leave this field out to get the first page.
<Warning>When paginating, keep all original filters across subsequent requests.</Warning>

## Filtering

Some list endpoints support different shapes for query parameters.
For parameters that support them, possible comparison operators are `= or eq` (equal),
`neq` (not equal), `gt` (greater than), `lt` (less than), `gte` (greater than or equal),
`lte` (less than or equal), `in` (in a list), and `nin` (not in a list).

For `in` and `nin` the API accepts a comma separated string e.g. `value_1,value_2`.

More details can be found in each individual endpoint's documentation.


## Rate Limits

The Trackstar API has a rate limit of 10 requests per second for GET requests. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

The API will return the following headers to indicate your current rate limit status:
```json
{
    "x-rate-limit-limit": "10",
    "x-rate-limit-remaining": "9",
    "x-rate-limit-reset": "1746126611",
    "x-rate-limit-retry-after": "1"
}
```
- `x-rate-limit-limit`: The total number of requests allowed per second.
- `x-rate-limit-remaining`: The number of requests you have remaining in the current second.
- `x-rate-limit-reset`: The epoch time when your rate limit will reset.
- `x-rate-limit-retry-after`: The number of seconds you should wait before making another request.
