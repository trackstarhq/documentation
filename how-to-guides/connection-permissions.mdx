When a connection is installed in Trackstar, it will most likely look like this:

    <img src="/images/full-permissions.png" alt="Full Permissions" />

Occasionally, however, the connection may not be fully able to access all the aspects of the underlying system. In that case, you may see these in your [Trackstar Link](/how-to-guides/trackstar-link) or UI:

    <img src="/images/missing-permissions.png" alt="Missing Permissions" />

You will also receive a `connection-error.created` [webhook](/how-to-guides/webhooks) and see a populated `errors` array when [querying connections](/api-reference/mgmt/get-connections).

In that case you may want to notify your customer that they are missing permissions for the URL listed.
Some systems allow the user to resolve these with their system operators.
Other times, the connection may need to be reinstalled.
You can either do this in your UI yourself (if you have permissions),
generate a [magic link](/how-to-guides/trackstar-link#sending-a-magic-link) with the `connection_id` property,
or send the `connection_id` when [generating your user's link token](/api-reference/mgmt/create-link-token).

    <img src="/images/reinstall.png" alt="Reinstall" />

The connection will be reinstalled with the same ID and new credentials, and no historical data will be lost.
