When a connection is installed in Trackstar, it will most likely look like this:

    <img src="/images/full-permissions.png" alt="Full Permissions" />

Occasionally, however, the connection may not be fully able to access all the aspects of the underlying system. In that case, you may see these in your [Trackstar Link](/how-to-guides/trackstar-link) or UI:

    <img src="/images/missing-permissions.png" alt="Missing Permissions" />

You will also receive a `connection-error.created` [webhook](/how-to-guides/webhooks) and see a populated `errors` array when [querying connections](/api-reference/mgmt/get-connections).

## Reinstalling a Connection

Some systems can be updated to provide the necessary permissions. (e.g. updating the user's role in the WMS)

Others may require a full reinstallation of the connection. There are three ways to reinstall a connection:

- In the [Trackstar Dashboard](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/connections) by clicking the "Reinstall Connection" button within the connection row
- By generationg a [magic link](/how-to-guides/trackstar-link#sending-a-magic-link) with the `Reinstall Connection Id (Optional)` field filled in
- Or by sending the `connection_id` when [generating your user's link token](/api-reference/mgmt/create-link-token) in the embedded Trackstar Link flow

The connection will be reinstalled with the same ID and new credentials, and no historical data will be lost.
