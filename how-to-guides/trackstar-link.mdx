Trackstar provides a component to allow your customers to easily and securely connect to any WMS.
This component can be embedded into your application, or sent as a "Magic Link" to your customers.

## Setting up Trackstar Link

There are two ways to set up Trackstar Link:

1. **Embedding the component**: You can embed the Trackstar Link component into your application.
This is the recommended way to use Trackstar Link, as it provides a seamless experience for your customers.

2. **Sending a Magic Link**: You can send a Magic Link to your customers.
This is useful if you don't have a web application, or if you want to provide a quick way for your customers to connect to a WMS.

We have published an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trackstar/react-trackstar-link" target="_blank">NPM package</a> to make it easy to embed the Trackstar Link component into your application.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Yarn
    yarn add @trackstar/react-trackstar-link
  ```
  ```bash NPM
    npm install @trackstar/react-trackstar-link
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

Once you have installed the package, you can use the `TrackstarLink` component in your application.
```jsx
import { TrackstarConnectButton } from '@trackstar/react-trackstar-link';

function App() {

  const someCustomerId = "12345";
  return (
    <TrackstarConnectButton
      getLinkToken={async () => {
        // See step 2.1 in How To Guides -> Getting Started
        const response = await fetch('https://my-company.backend.com/get-link-token',
          {
            method: 'POST',
          }
        );
        const { linkToken } = await response.json();
        return linkToken;
      }}
      onSuccess={async (authCode) =>
        // See step 2.2 in How To Guides -> Getting Started
        await fetch('https://my-company.backend.com/store-token',
          {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({
              customer_id: someCustomerId,
              auth_code: authCode,
            }),
          }
        )
      }
      onClose={() => console.log('closed')}
      onLoad={() => console.log('loaded')}
      // sandbox={true} // Set to true to include a "Sandbox" WMS in the list of integrations
    >
      Connect your WMS
    </TrackstarConnectButton>
  );
}
```
