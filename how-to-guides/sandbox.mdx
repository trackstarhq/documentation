Trackstar API provides a sandbox environment for testing and development.

The sandbox environment is a copy of the production environment, but with mocked out data.
You can use the sandbox to get familiar with the API and test your integrations, without affecting your production data.

## 1. Get an API key
You will need an API key to make API calls. See [Getting-Started](/how-to-guides/getting-started#1-get-an-api-key)
for how to get one.

## 2. Set Up Your Sandbox
Use the API key to make a request to the sandbox reset endpoint. This will set up the sandbox and return an **access-token**.
```python
import requests

url = "https://production.trackstarhq.com/sandbox/reset-sandbox"
headers = {
 "x-trackstar-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()
response = response.json()
```
If successful, you should get a response like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "some_access_token",
  "integration_name": "sandbox",
}
```

## 3. Make API calls

Now you can use the access token to make API calls to Trackstar's sandbox!

```python
import requests

url = "https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory"
headers = {
 "x-trackstar-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
 "x-trackstar-access-token": "an_access_token" # from the prior step
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()
response = response.json()
```

You can read the API reference for all supported operations.

## 4. Reset the Sandbox
You can reset the sandbox at any time by making a request to the reset-sandbox endpoint as shown in [Step 2](/how-to-guides/sandbox#2-set-up-your-sandbox).
