title: "Sandbox"
---

Trackstar API provides a sandbox environment for testing and development.

The sandbox environment is a copy of the production environment, but with mocked out data.
You can use the sandbox to get familiar with the API and test your integrations, without affecting your production data.

## 1. Get an API key
You will need an API key to make API calls. See the [Getting Started](/how-to-guides/getting-started#1-get-an-api-key)
page for how to get one.

## 2. Get your Sandbox Access Token

We automatically generate sandbox data for you when sign up for Trackstar. Navigate to the [connections page](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/connections) and 
find the connection row with Integration Name "Sandbox". Click on the key icon to get the access token.

## 3. Make API calls

Now you can use the API Key and Access Token to make API calls to Trackstar's sandbox!

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import requests

url = "https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory"
headers = {
 "x-trackstar-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
 "x-trackstar-access-token": "an_access_token" # from the prior step
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()
response = response.json()
```
```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory';

const headers = {
  'x-trackstar-api-key': "YOUR_API_KEY",
  'x-trackstar-access-token': "an_access_token", // from the prior step
};

const response = await axios.get(url, { headers });
```
```bash curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory \
  --header 'x-trackstar-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'x-trackstar-access-token: an_access_token' # from the prior step
```
</CodeGroup>
You can read the API reference for all supported operations.

## 4. Sandbox Integration in Trackstar Link

You can enable a "Sandbox" integration in Trackstar Link by setting the `sandbox` prop in the [Trackstar React Component](/how-to-guides/getting-started#4-implement-react-trackstar-link-fe). 
If you go through the auth flow for the Sandbox integration, it will return an auth code that you can [exchange for an access token](api-reference/mgmt/exchange-auth-code).

This is useful for:

1. Testing the end-to-end Trackstar integration flow without needing WMS credentials. 
2. Completing the link exchange generates sandbox data and returns an access token that you can use to make API calls to the sandbox. (Like in step 2 above)

## 5. Sandbox UI

You can view and edit the Sandbox data directly in [the Trackstar Dashboard](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/sandbox).

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/sandbox.png" alt="Sandbox UI" />
</Frame>

This data matches the data you see in the API responses. Within the UI you can simulate common WMS operations such as fulfulling an order and see the changes reflected in the API responses.
Additionally, all changes will trigger webhooks, so you can test your integration with Trackstar's webhooks as well.
