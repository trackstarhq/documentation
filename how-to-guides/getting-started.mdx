## Quick Setup (No Coding Required)

You can start connecting WMS systems to Trackstar in minutes without writing any code using one of these methods:

1. Inputting WMS credentials directly into the Trackstar dashboard.
2. Sending a Magic Link to your customers to connect their WMS.

### 1. Inputting WMS Credentials

If your customer has provided you with their WMS credentials, you can input them directly into the Trackstar dashboard.

1. Go to the [Connections page](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/connections) in the Trackstar dashboard.
2. Click the "Add Connection" button.
3. Select the WMS you want to connect.
4. Fill in the required fields (e.g. API key, username, password).
5. An access token will be generated for you. This token is used to authenticate requests to Trackstar.

### 2. Sending a Magic Link

If you don't have your customer's WMS credentials, you can send them a Magic Link to connect their WMS.

1. Go to the [Connections page](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/connections) in the Trackstar dashboard.
2. Click the "Generate Magic Link" button.
3. Fill out the settings for the Magic Link (e.g. expiration time, available actions).
4. Send the generated URL to your customer.
5. Your customer will be able to connect their WMS by opening the link and entering their WMS credentials.
6. Once completed, you can find the access token in the Trackstar dashboard.

## Fully Embedded Setup (Coding Required)

The following guide will walk you through integrating [Trackstar Link](/how-to-guides/trackstar-link) into your application. Trackstar Link is a javascript component that you embed in your frontend to allow your users to connect their WMS via Trackstar.

If you get stuck or have trouble, email us at `support@trackstarhq.com`.

Fully setting up Trackstar will require updates to both your frontend (FE) and backend (BE) code. We will denote which steps are for the frontend and which are for the backend.

Your frontend will make calls to your backend, which will in turn make calls to the Trackstar API. This gets the authorization necessary for your user to authenticate with Trackstar and the underlying APIs.

### 1. Get an API key

You can find your API keys in the [Trackstar dashboard](https://dashboard.trackstarhq.com/settings/api-keys).

Test it by making an API call to the `POST /link/token` endpoint to get a link token.

```bash
curl -X POST https://production.trackstarhq.com/link/token \
    -H 'x-trackstar-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

If successful, you should get a response like this:

```json
{
  "link_token": "some_link_token"
}
```

**Store this API key somewhere safe!** This will be the API key for your whole organization.

### 2. Implement Token Exchange Endpoints (BE)

There are two backend API endpoints that you need to implement. (Note: you can name these endpoints whatever you want, but we will use the names `/get-link-token` and `/store-token` in this guide).

- `POST /get-link-token` - Returns a **temporary link token** that is used to initialize the `react-trackstar-link` component.
- `POST /store-token` - Exchanges a **temporary auth code** for a **permanent access token** and saves it to a database. This access token is associated with a customer and an integration (ShipBob, Extensiv, etc).

We will use a combination of Python + Flask or Node.js + Express + Axios in this guide, but you can use any language and framework you want.

#### 2.1 `/get-link-token`

**Link tokens** are temporary access keys granted to your frontend to make API calls on behalf of your organization. Your frontend will call this endpoint to get a link token. You will see this being called in step 4.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from flask import Flask
import requests

TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = ""

@app.route("/get-link-token", methods=["POST"])
def link_token():
    response = requests.post(
        "https://production.trackstarhq.com/link/token",
        headers={
            "x-trackstar-api-key": TRACKSTAR_API_KEY,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    response = response.json()
    link_token = response["link_token"]
    return {"linkToken": link_token}
```


```javascript Node.js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = '';

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/get-link-token', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      'https://production.trackstarhq.com/link/token',
      null,
      {
        headers: {
          'x-trackstar-api-key': TRACKSTAR_API_KEY
        },
      },
    );

    const { link_token } = response.data;

    res.send({ linkToken: link_token });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Error getting link token');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 2.2 `/store-token`

After a user installs an integration, the frontend will send an **auth code** to the backend, along with any relevant customer data. The **auth code** is a temporary token that you must exchange via Trackstar's `/link/exchange` endpoint to get a long-lived `access_token`.

Additionally, a `connection_id` and `integration_name` will be returned. **Connection IDs** are unique identifiers for each connected integration. You should store these in your database along with the `access_token` if you plan on utilizing Trackstar Webhooks.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = ""

@app.route("/store-token", methods=["POST"])
def store_token():
    body = request.get_json()
    customer_id = body.get("customer_id") # and any other relevant info from your FE
    auth_code = body.get("auth_code")

    # Call Trackstar API to get access_token (and integration_name)
    response = requests.post(
        "https://production.trackstarhq.com/link/exchange",
        json={"auth_code": auth_code},
        headers={
            "x-trackstar-api-key": TRACKSTAR_API_KEY,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    response = response.json()
    access_token, connection_id, integration_name, available_actions = (
        response["access_token"],
        response["connection_id"],
        response["integration_name"],
        response["available_actions"],
    )
    # Store customer_id, access_token, connection_id, integration_name in your database
    access_tokens_table = ...
    row = {
      "customer_id": customer_id,
      "access_token": access_token,
      "connection_id": connection_id,
      "integration_name": integration_name,
      "available_actions": available_actions,
    }
    access_tokens_table.put(row)
    return "Success!" # back to your frontend
```


```javascript Node.js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = '';

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/store-token', async (req, res) => {
  const { customer_id, auth_code } = req.body;
  // And any other relevant info from your frontend

  try {
    // Call Trackstar API to get access_token (and integration_name)
    const response = await axios.post(
      'https://production.trackstarhq.com/link/exchange',
      { auth_code },
      {
        headers: {
          'x-trackstar-api-key': TRACKSTAR_API_KEY,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
      },
    );

    const { access_token, connection_id, integration_name } = response.data;

    // Store customer_id, access_token, integration_name in your database
    const access_tokens_table = ...;
    const row = {
      customer_id,
      access_token,
      connection_id,
      integration_name,
    };
    await access_tokens_table.put(row);

    res.send('Success!'); // back to your frontend
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Error storing token');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Install react-trackstar-link (FE)

In your frontend code, install the official [react-trackstar-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trackstar/react-trackstar-link) package.

```bash npm
npm install @trackstar/react-trackstar-link
```

or

```bash yarn
yarn add @trackstar/react-trackstar-link
```

### 4. Implement react-trackstar-link (FE)

In your frontend code, import the `TrackstarConnectButton` component and render it in your app.

```jsx
import { TrackstarConnectButton } from '@trackstar/react-trackstar-link';

function App() {

  const someCustomerId = "12345";
  return (
    <TrackstarConnectButton
      getLinkToken={async () => {
        // the endpoint you implemented in step 2.1
        const response = await fetch('https://my-company.backend.com/get-link-token',
          {
            method: 'POST',
          }
        );
        const { linkToken } = await response.json();
        return linkToken;
      }}
      onSuccess={async (authCode, integrationName) =>
        // the endpoint you implemented in step 2.2
        await fetch('https://my-company.backend.com/store-token',
          {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
              customer_id: someCustomerId,
              auth_code: authCode,
              integration_name: integrationName,
            }),
          }
        )
      }
      onClose={() => console.log('closed')}
      onLoad={() => console.log('loaded')}
      // sandbox={true} // Set to true to include a "Sandbox" WMS in the list of integrations
    >
      Connect your WMS
    </TrackstarConnectButton>
  );
}
```

More documentation, including additional properties, can be found [here](https://github.com/trackstarhq/react-trackstar-link).

### 5. Make API calls (BE)

Now you can use the access token to make API calls to Trackstar!

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = ""
ACCESS_TOKEN = ""

url = "https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory"
headers = {
 "x-trackstar-api-key": TRACKSTAR_API_KEY,
 "x-trackstar-access-token": ACCESS_TOKEN, # from your database that you stored in step 2.2
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()
response = response.json()
# Make magic happen
```


```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const TRACKSTAR_API_KEY = '';
const ACCESS_TOKEN = '';
const url = 'https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory';
const headers = {
  'x-trackstar-api-key': TRACKSTAR_API_KEY,
  'x-trackstar-access-token': ACCESS_TOKEN, // from your database that you stored in step 2.2
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

axios
  .get(url, { headers })
  .then((response) => {
    const data = response.data;
    // Make magic happen
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

</CodeGroup>

You can read the API reference for all supported operations.
