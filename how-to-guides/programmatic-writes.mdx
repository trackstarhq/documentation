title: "Trackstar Writes"
---

The Trackstar API enables you to write data.

You can create new entities (POST) and update existing entities (PUT) in your end users' connected accounts.

Request Body
---
Every write request requires a JSON body.

The request body will differ depending on the type of write request you are making, and the integeration you are writing to.
To learn the format of the request body, you can leverage our ```meta``` endpoint.

Meta Endpoint
---
Instead of building customized logic for every integration, ```/meta``` allows you to:

- Dynamically prompt users for required/optional fields
- Programmatically account for differences across integrations
- Validate POST/PUT requests for all required information

Example Response
```json Response
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "id": {
            "description": "ID for the field",
            "type": "string",
        },
        "items": {
            "description": "List of items",
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "id": {"description": "SKU of the product", "type": "string"},
                    "additional_details": {"description": "Additional details", "type": "string"},
                },
                "required": ["id"],
                "additionalProperties": false,
            },
        },
    },
    "required": ["id", "items"],
}
```


Get Request to /meta
---
All Trackstar POST and PUTs have an associated ```meta``` endpoint.

The ```meta``` endpoint has a required query parameter ```method```, which can be either ```POST``` or ```PUT```.

For example, to get the integration specific schema for a succesful POST request to create an order, you would call ```GET wms/orders/meta?method=POST```.

Write Request Flow
---
1. Call `GET /meta?method=<METHOD>` to get the schema of the request body.
2. Create a JSON object that matches the schema.
3. Call the write endpoint with the JSON object as the request body.
