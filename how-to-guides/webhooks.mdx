Use Trackstar webhooks to be notified every time a certain event occurs. 
Contact us if you'd like to set up webhooks for your account.

Webhooks can be configured to listen for the following:

Event types
---

`inventory.created/updated`<br />
`product.created/updated`<br />
`order.created/updated`<br />
`inbound_shipment.created/updated`<br />
`shipping_method.created/updated`<br />
`return.created/updated`<br />
`warehouse.created/updated`<br />
`connection.created/deleted`<br />
`connection-error.created/updated/deleted`

Webhooks will point to a specific **URL** that you must set up. This URL must
accept `POST` requests with the `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

Webhook Message Schema
---

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection_id` | `string` | The ID of the connection from which the event occurred. |
| `data` | `object` | The created or updated object. |
| `event_type` | `string` | The type of event that occurred. See above for the list of types. |
| `integration_name` | `string` | The name of the integration from which the event occurred. |
| `previous_attributes` | `object` | _Only present on updated events._ The previous values of the fields that were updated. If the change occurs within a nested field, we will represent that change via a `"."` joined string where integers represent the index of the array, and strings represent object keys. |


Sample Webhook Message
---
```
{
    "connection_id": "connection_id",
    "data": {
        "created_date": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
        "expected_arrival_date": "2022-06-09T00:00:00Z",
        "id": "id",
        "line_items": [
            {
                "expected_quantity": 1,
                "inventory_item_id": "inventory_item_id_1",
                "received_quantity": 1,
                "sku": "sku1",
            },
            {
                "expected_quantity": 2,
                "inventory_item_id": "inventory_item_id_2",
                "received_quantity": 2,
                "sku": "sku2",
            },
        ],
        "purchase_order_number": "PO#",
        "status": "received",
        "supplier": "supplier",
        "updated_date": "2023-06-14T15:36:48Z",
        "warehouse_id": "warehouse_id",
    },
    "event_type": "inbound_shipment.updated",
    "integration_name": "integration_name",
    "previous_attributes": {
      "status": "open",
      "line_items.1.received_quantity": 1
    },
}
```

Note: In the example above, `status` changed from "open" to "received" and the `received_quantity` of the second line item changed from 1 to 2.

`line_items.1.received_quantity` is referring to `data.line_items[1].received_quantity`
