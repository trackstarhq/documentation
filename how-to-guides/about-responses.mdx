The Trackstar API can be hit at https://production.trackstarhq.com.

Trackstar API responses are all returned in JSON format.

## Errors

Errors are returned in the following format:
```json
{
    "error": "Sample error message"
}
```
and will have a status code associated with them.
If the error is due to throttling (a status code of **429**), the error will also have a `retry_after_seconds` field:
```json
{
    "error": "Integration API rate limit exceeded",
    "retry_after_seconds": 10
}
```
## Pagination

Endpoints that list data retrieve the optimal number of items on a per-integration basis.
These endpoints implement pagination logic and return a `next_token`, which will be `null` if there is no additional data.
Valid `next_token`s can then be passed into the endpoint's `page_token` parameter to get the next page of results.
Leave this field out to get the first page.
