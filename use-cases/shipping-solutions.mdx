Shipping is a critical component of order fulfillment. This guide shows you how to ship orders and attach shipping labels using the Trackstar API.

## Overview

The shipping workflow typically involves:
1. Creating shipments with tracking information
2. Attaching shipping labels and documentation
3. Providing tracking details to customers

## Shipping an Order

Use the [Create Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/orders/create-shipment) to mark an order as fulfilled and provide shipment and tracking information.

### Sample Request
```
POST https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/orders/order_abc123/shipments
```

```json
{
  "shipped_date": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "carrier_id": "fedex",
  "shipping_method_id": "fedex_ground",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "packages": [
    {
      "package_id": "pkg_001",
      "tracking_number": "1Z999AA1234567890"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multi-Package Shipment

For orders that ship in multiple packages:

```json
{
  "shipped_date": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "carrier_id": "ups",
  "shipping_method_id": "ups_ground",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "packages": [
    {
      "package_id": "pkg_001",
      "tracking_number": "1Z999AA1234567890"
    },
    {
      "package_id": "pkg_002",
      "tracking_number": "1Z999AA1234567891"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Adding Shipping Labels

Use the [Attach File endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/orders/attach-file) to attach shipping labels and other documentation to orders.

### Sample Request

```
POST https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/orders/order_abc123/file
```

**Request Body (multipart/form-data):**
```json
{
  "file_url": "https://labels.example.com/shipping_label_123.pdf",
  "file_name": "shipping_label.pdf",
  "file": "[binary file data]"
}
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "file_abc123"
  }
}
```

## Order Status Updates

Creating a shipment automatically updates the order status to "fulfilled" in Trackstar. This status change will trigger webhooks to keep your systems synchronized.
