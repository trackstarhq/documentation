Order fulfillment is a core workflow in warehouse management systems. This guide shows you how to create orders and track their progress through the fulfillment process.

## Overview

The order fulfillment process typically involves:
1. Creating an order with product details
2. Tracking order status through the fulfillment pipeline
3. Syncing updates and managing order data

## Creating Orders

To create an order, use the [Create Order endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/orders/post) with the required order information including products, quantities, and shipping details.

### Required Fields

When creating an order, you'll need to provide:
- **warehouse_customer_id**: The merchant/tenant ID that owns the order
- **reference_id**: Your external unique order identifier
- **order_number**: A user-friendly order identifier
- **ship_to_address**: Complete shipping destination details
- **line_items**: Array of products with SKUs, quantities, and pricing
- **shipping_method**: The shipping method to use
- **service_level**: Type of shipping service (Standard, Express, etc.)

Among a few others. See the [documentation](/api-reference/wms-api/orders/post) for all required fields.
