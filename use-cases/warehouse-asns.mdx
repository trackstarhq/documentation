Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs) are critical for efficient warehouse operations. This guide shows you how to create inbound shipments and track their progress using the Trackstar API.

## Overview

The ASN workflow typically involves:
1. Creating inbound shipments for incoming goods
2. Tracking receipt and processing status

## Creating Inbound Shipments

Use the [Create Inbound Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inbound-shipments/post) to create ASNs before goods arrive at the warehouse.

### Sample Request

```
POST https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inbound-shipments
```

```json
{
  "supplier_object": {
    "supplier_id": "ACME001",
    "supplier_name": "Acme Suppliers Inc"
  },
  "purchase_order_number": "PO-2024-001",
  "expected_arrival_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "tracking_number": "1234567890",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "sku": "WIDGET-001",
      "expected_quantity": 100
    },
    {
      "sku": "GADGET-002",
      "expected_quantity": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "inbound_shipment_abc123",
    "supplier_object": {
      "supplier_id": "ACME001",
      "supplier_name": "Acme Suppliers Inc"
    },
    "purchase_order_number": "PO-2024-001",
    "status": "open",
    "expected_arrival_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
    "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
    "tracking_number": "1234567890",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "sku": "WIDGET-001",
        "expected_quantity": 100,
        "unit_cost": 25.00
      },
      {
        "sku": "GADGET-002",
        "expected_quantity": 50,
        "unit_cost": 45.00
      }
    ],
    "receipts": []
  }
}
```

## Tracking Inbound Shipment Updates

Once inbound shipments are created, you can track their progress using the [Get Inbound Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inbound-shipments/get-item).

### Sample Request

```
GET https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inbound-shipments/inbound_shipment_abc123
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "inbound_shipment_abc123",
    "warehouse_customer_id": "customer_12345",
    "status": "received",
    "expected_arrival_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
    "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
    "supplier_object": {
      "supplier_id": "ACME001",
      "supplier_name": "Acme Suppliers Inc"
    },
    "purchase_order_number": "PO-2024-001",
    "tracking_numbers": ["1234567890"],
    "ship_from_address": {
      "name": "Acme Suppliers Inc",
      "address1": "100 Supplier Blvd",
      "city": "Supplier City",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip_code": "90210"
    },
    "line_items": [
      {
        "sku": "WIDGET-001",
        "expected_quantity": 100,
        "receieved_quantity": 100,
        "unit_cost": 25.00
      },
      {
        "sku": "GADGET-002",
        "expected_quantity": 50,
        "receieved_quantity": 50,
        "unit_cost": 45.00
      }
    ],
    "receipts": [
      {
        "arrived_date": "2024-01-20T10:15:00Z",
        "line_items": [
          {
            "sku": "WIDGET-001",
            "quantity": 100
          },
          {
            "sku": "GADGET-002",
            "quantity": 50
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Fetching ASNs

You can retrieve detailed information about specific inbound shipments using the [Get Inbound Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inbound-shipments/get-item). This allows you to check status updates, receipt details, and track the progress of your ASNs.

### Sample Request

```
GET https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inbound-shipments/inbound_shipment_abc123
```

### Sample Response

```json
