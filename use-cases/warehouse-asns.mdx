Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs) are critical for efficient warehouse operations. This guide shows you how to create inbound shipments and track their progress using the Trackstar API.

## Overview

The ASN workflow typically involves:
1. Creating inbound shipments for incoming goods
2. Tracking receipt and processing status

## Creating Inbound Shipments

Use the [Create Inbound Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inbound-shipments/post) to create ASNs before goods arrive at the warehouse.

### Sample Request

```
POST https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inbound-shipments
```

```json
{
  "supplier_object": {
    "supplier_id": "ACME001",
    "supplier_name": "Acme Suppliers Inc"
  },
  "purchase_order_number": "PO-2024-001",
  "expected_arrival_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "tracking_number": "1234567890",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "sku": "WIDGET-001",
      "expected_quantity": 100
    },
    {
      "sku": "GADGET-002",
      "expected_quantity": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample Response

```json

## Tracking Inbound Shipment Updates

Once inbound shipments are created, you can track their progress using the [Get Inbound Shipment endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inbound-shipments/get-item).

### Sample Request

```
GET https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inbound-shipments/inbound_shipment_abc123
