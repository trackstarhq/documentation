Effective inventory management is crucial for maintaining optimal stock levels and preventing stockouts or overstock situations. This guide shows you how to fetch inventory data and make adjustments using the Trackstar API.

## Overview

The inventory management workflow typically involves:
1. Fetching current stock levels across warehouses
2. Making inventory adjustments for corrections or updates
3. Monitoring inventory changes and levels

## Getting Inventory Data

Use the [Get Inventory endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/get) to retrieve current stock levels across all locations and products.

### Fetching All Inventory

```
GET https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory
```

### Sample Response

```json

}
```

## Understanding Inventory Levels

For detailed information about inventory breakdowns, see the [Inventory Info page](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/info).

## Adjusting Inventory

When you need to adjust inventory levels due to damage, loss, cycle counts, or receiving new stock, use the [Adjust Inventory endpoint](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/adjust).

### Making Inventory Adjustments

```
PUT https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory/{inventory_id}/adjust
```

### Sample Adjustment Request - Increase

```
PUT https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory/inv_widget001_main/adjust
```

```json
{
  "quantity": 50,
  "adjustment_type": "increase",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "location_id": "A-01-15-02"
}
```

### Sample Adjustment Request - Decrease

```
PUT https://production.trackstarhq.com/wms/inventory/inv_widget001_main/adjust
```

```json
{
  "quantity": -5,
  "adjustment_type": "decrease",
  "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
  "location_id": "A-01-15-02"
}
```


## Multi-Location Inventory

Trackstar tracks inventory across multiple warehouses and specific locations within each warehouse.

### Warehouse-Level Inventory

Each inventory item shows totals by warehouse:

```json
{
  "inventory_by_warehouse_id": {
    "warehouse_main": {
      "onhand": 100,
      "committed": 15,
      "fulfillable": 85
    },
    "warehouse_east": {
      "onhand": 50,
      "committed": 10,
      "fulfillable": 40
    }
  }
}
```

### Location-Level Details

Specific storage locations within warehouses:

```json
{
  "locations": [
    {
      "location_id": "A-01-15-02",
      "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
      "quantity": 75
    },
    {
      "location_id": "B-02-08-01",
      "warehouse_id": "warehouse_main",
      "quantity": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Inventory Monitoring
- Fetch inventory data regularly to stay updated on stock levels
- Monitor fulfillable quantities to prevent overselling
- Always specify warehouse and location when possible for precise adjustments
- Use descriptive reasons in your internal systems for audit trails
