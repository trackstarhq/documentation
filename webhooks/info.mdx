Use Trackstar webhooks to be notified every time a certain event occurs. Trackstar scrapes
your WMS every five minutes, providing instant alerts on a per-integration basis.

Webhooks can be configured to listen for certain **topics**:
- `orders/created`: Get notified every time an order is created in your WMS.
- `orders/status_changed`: Get notified when an order's status changes -
for example, when it goes from `open` to `allocated`.
See the [order definition](/wms-api/orders/info) for more.

Webhooks will point to a specific **URL** that you must set up. This URL must
accept `POST` requests with the `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

Sample Webhook Message:
---
```
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "resource_type": "orders",
      "resource": {
        "id": "order-1",
        "status": "allocated"
      },
      "event": "created"
    },
    {
      "resource_type": "orders",
      "resource": {
        "id": "order-2",
        "status": "allocated"
      },
      "event": "status_changed",
      "change": {
        "field": "status",
        "from": "open",
        "to": "allocated"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
