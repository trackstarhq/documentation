## Product

A product is a virtual record of a product sold on an online store. It contains information about the product, such as its name, and sku, 
and a list of inventory item ids that are associated with the product.

## Inventory

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

The `inventory_item_id` list returned from the `Product` endpoint map to the `Inventory` endpoint.

An `inventory_item_id` may be a sku, variant, or other identifier that is used to track the product in the warehouse. It vaires by WMS.

To most accurately map a `SKU` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the `Product` endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list. 
Then, call the `Inventory` endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.
