## Product

A product is a virtual record of a product sold on an online store. It contains information about the product, such as its name, and sku,
and a list of inventory item ids that are associated with the product.

## Inventory

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the `Product` endpoint maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the `Product` endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the `Inventory` endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.

### Inventory Breakdowns
| Field       | Definition                                                          | Formula
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------
| Onhand      | Total quantity in the warehouse.                                    | Committed + Fulfillable
| Committed   | Inventory that is already assigned to orders.
| Fulfillable | Inventory that can be fulfilled for orders.                         | Exception + Unknown + Sellable
| Exception   | Inventory that is in exception status - quarantined, broken, etc.
| Unknown     | Inventory that cannot be sold for another reason - reserved, etc.
| Sellable    | Inventory that can be sold.
| Awaiting    | Inventory that is expected to arrive to a warehouse.

## Order

An order is a purchase made by a customer. It contains information about the order,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains a `product_id` that maps to the `id` field in the `Product` endpoint.
The line item may also include a `sku`.

## Purchase Order

A purchase order (PO) is a record of a purchase made by a buyer to a supplier (aka vendor or factory). It contains information about the PO,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains an `inventory_item_id` that maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.
The line item may also include a `sku`.

POs also contains the information you would find in an "Incoming Shipment" or "Advance Shipment Notice" (ASN). Use
this endpoint to understand incoming inventory to a warehouse.

## Shipping Method

A shipping method is an available carrier that can be used to ship orders (e.g., FedEx Ground or UPS Next Day). It contains a `name`, a `code`, and in some cases an additional `description`.
The `name` and `code` must be passed in the body of the `shipping_method` object as `carrier_name` and `carrier_code` when creating a order.

## Return (RMA)
A return is an instance of a customer sending one or multiple products back to a warehouse. It contains information about the return,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains an `inventory_item_id` that maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.

## Warehouse

A warehouse is a physical location where inventory is stored. It contains information about the warehouse, such as its name and code.
