## Product

A product is a virtual record of a product sold on an online store. It contains information about the product, such as its name, and sku,
and a list of inventory item ids that are associated with the product.

## Inventory

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the `Product` endpoint maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the `Product` endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the `Inventory` endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.

## Order

An order a purchase made by a customer. It contains information about the order,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains a `product_id` that maps to the `id` field in the `Product` endpoint.
The line item may also include a `sku`.

## Purchase Order

A purchase order is a record of a purchase made by a buyer to a supplier (aka vendor or factory). It contains information about the purchase,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains an `inventory_item_id` that maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.
The line item may also include a `sku`.

## Shipping Method

A shipping method is an available carrier that can be used to ship orders (e.g., FedEx Ground or UPS Next Day). It contains a `name`, a `code`, and in some cases an additional `description`.
The `name` and `code` must be passed in the body of the `shipping_method` object as `carrier_name` and `carrier_code` when creating a order.
