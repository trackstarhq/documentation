title: "Warehouse Customers"
---

A Warehouse Customer is the merchant/owner of inventory, orders, etc...

If a connected Warehouse Management System belongs to a 3PL (or has many customers in their warehouse),
each object from the Trackstar API will have a `warehouse_customer_id` that designates which Warehouse Customer that object belongs to.
