title: "Inventory"

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the `Product` endpoint maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the `Product` endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the `Inventory` endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.
