A product is a virtual record of a product sold on an online store. It contains information about the product, such as its name, sku,
and a list of inventory item IDs that make up the product.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the `Product` endpoint maps to the `id` field in the `Inventory` endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the `Product` endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the `/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}` endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.
