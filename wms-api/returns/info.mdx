## Return

A Return, also known as a Return Merchandise Authorization or RMA, is an instance of a customer sending one or multiple products back to a warehouse.
It contains information about the individual items being returned, such as their inventory IDs and whether or not they have been restocked at that warehouse.

The `inventory_item_id` in each line item can be passed into the `/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}` endpoint for more details.
