title: "Inbound Shipments"

An Inbound Shipment (also known as an Advance Shipping Notice, ASN, or Receiving Order) is a record of a shipment from a supplier
(usually a vendor or factory) to a warehouse. Shipments are often associated with a Purchase Order, which represents the order
that the warehouse sent to the supplier.

The Inbound Shipment contains information about the items being sent, including their individual
`inventory_item_id`s. These IDs can be passed into the [`/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}`](/wms-api/inventory/get-item) endpoint for more details.

### Inbound Shipment Statuses (in order of lifecycle)
| Status       | Definition
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------
| `open`       | Shipment record has been created and items are not yet in the warehouse.
| `received`   | Items have been received in the warehouse.
| `cancelled`  | Shipment has been cancelled by either the warehouse or the customer.
| `other`      | Status of the shipment can't be determined. Often due to a custom status being used.
