### Response

The top level of the Meta Response will contain `type: "object"`, `properties`, and `required`.

Each key, value pair within properties represents a field. If the field is of type `object` then the field will contain it's own `properties`. 
If the field is of type `array` then the value will be an object with a key `items` which will contain the schema for the items in the array.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `enum` | Specifies the data type of the field. Can be ```string```, ```object```, ```array```, ```integer``` |
| `enum` | `array` | If present, then `type` will not be. List of possible values for the field. |
| `properties` | `object` | _Only present on type object._ The properties on an object, where each key is the name of a field and each value is a schema used to validate that field. |
| `description` | `string` | The description of the field. |
| `pattern` | `string` | _Only present on string fields._ The regex pattern of the string that is validated against. |
| `required` | `array` | List of required fields. |
| `additionalProperties` | `boolean` | Whether or not additional properties (properties that are not listed in the schema) are allowed. |
| `items` | `object` | _Only present on type array._ The schema for the items in the array. |
