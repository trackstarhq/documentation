| `properties` | `object` | _Only present on type object._ The properties on an object, where each key is the name of a field and each value is a schema used to validate that field. |
| `required` | `array` | List of required fields. |
| `description` | `string` | The description of the field. |
| `pattern` | `string` | _Only present on string fields._ The regex pattern of the string that is validated against. |
| `enum` | `array` | If present, then `type` will not be. List of possible values for the field. |
| `items` | `object` | _Only present on type array._ The schema for the items in the array. |
