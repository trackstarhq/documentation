A product is a virtual record of a product sold on an online store. It contains information about the product, such as its name, `sku`,
and a list of inventory items that make up the product.

Each `inventory_item` returned from the Product endpoint has an `inventory_item_id` that maps to the `id` field in the [Inventory](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/info) endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the Product endpoint to get the `inventory_items` list.
Then, call the [`/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}`](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/get-item) endpoint to get the inventory levels for each `inventory_item_id`.
