title: "Inventory"
---

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the [Product](/api-reference/wms-api/products/info) endpoint maps to the `id` field in the Inventory endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the [Product](/api-reference/wms-api/products/info) endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the [`/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}`](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/get-item) endpoint to get the inventory levels for each Inventory Item.

### Inventory Breakdowns
| Field           | Definition                                                          | Formula
| :---------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------
| `awaiting`      | Inventory that is expected to arrive to a warehouse.
| `onhand`        | Total quantity in the warehouse.                                    | committed + unfulfillable + fulfillable (this formula does not apply if an item has substitute SKUs)
| `committed`     | Inventory that is already assigned to orders.
| `unfulfillable` | Inventory that is damaged, quarantined, etc...
| `fulfillable`   | Inventory that can be fulfilled and shipped for orders.
| `unsellable`    | Inventory that is being held from sales channels (e.g. reserved)    | `deprecated`
| `sellable`      | Inventory that is available in sales channels.

### Inventory Ledger
[Inventory ledger](/api-reference/wms-api/inventory/inventory-ledger) is designed as a time-series event log of inventory transactions that occurred at a specific point in time.
Each event is immutable and timestamped, so you’ll see the complete history of what happened to inventory over time rather than just the current state. Each transaction creates a new ledger entry, preserving the audit trail.

Example transactions that can create a new ledger entry:
- Quantity changes (receipts, shipments, adjustments, cycle counts)
- Inventory movements between locations/bins
- Status changes (available → reserved, etc.)
