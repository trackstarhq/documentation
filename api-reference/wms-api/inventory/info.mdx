title: "Inventory"
---

Inventory is a representation of a physical good in a warehouse. Each product has one or more inventory items associated with it.

Each `inventory_item_id` returned from the [Product](/wms-api/products/info) endpoint maps to the `id` field in the Inventory endpoint.

To most accurately map a `sku` or Product Name to inventory levels, first call the [Product](/wms-api/products/info) endpoint to get the `inventory_item_id` list.
Then, call the [`/wms-api/inventory/{inventory_item_id}`](/wms-api/inventory/get-item) endpoint to get the inventory levels for each Inventory Item.

### Inventory Breakdowns
| Field           | Definition                                                          | Formula

| `awaiting`      | Inventory that is expected to arrive to a warehouse.
| `onhand`        | Total quantity in the warehouse.                                    | committed + unfulfillable + fulfillable (this formula does not apply if an item has substitute SKUs)
| `committed`     | Inventory that is already assigned to orders.
| `unfulfillable` | Inventory that is damaged, quarantined, etc...
| `fulfillable`   | Inventory that can be fulfilled and shipped for orders.
| `unsellable`    | Inventory that is being held from sales channels (e.g. reserved)    | `deprecated`
| `sellable`      | Inventory that is available in sales channels.
