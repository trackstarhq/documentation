A bill is charged by a warehouse to a customer. Reasons for billing include shipping, storing, picking, packing, and more.
When appropriate, the ID of the object incurring the charge (often the order being shipped or unit being stored) will also be available.

<Note>Billing is disabled by default. Reach out to us if you would like to enable billing data.</Note>
