An order is a purchase made by a customer. It contains information about the order,
including the individual line items. Each line item contains a `product_id` that
can be passed to the [`/cart-api/products/{product_id}`](/api-reference/cart-api/products/get-item) for more details.
The line item may also include the item's `sku`, the parent product's ID, and the parent product's `sku`.
